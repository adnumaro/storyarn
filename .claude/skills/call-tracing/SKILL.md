# Call Tracing

Build call trees showing how functions are reached from entry points.

## Iron Laws - Never Violate These

1. **Always use `mix xref callers` first** - It's authoritative; grep is fallback only
2. **Stop at entry points** - Controllers, LiveView callbacks, Oban workers, GenServer callbacks
3. **Track visited MFAs** - Prevent infinite loops from circular calls
4. **Extract argument patterns** - Just knowing "who calls" isn't enough; HOW they call matters
5. **Max depth 10** - Deeper trees indicate architectural issues, not useful traces

## When to Build Call Tree (Use Proactively)

| Condition                       | Why Call Tree Helps                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Unexpected nil/value at runtime | Trace where the value originates             |
| Bug can't reproduce locally     | See all entry points that reach the code     |
| Changing function signature     | Find all callers and their argument patterns |
| Incomplete stack trace          | Get full path context                        |
| "Where does X come from?"       | Visual answer to data flow question          |

## Quick Trace

```bash
# Find all callers
mix xref callers MyApp.Accounts.update_user/2

# Output: lib/web/controllers/user_controller.ex:45: MyApp.Accounts.update_user/2

# Read that location to see arguments
```

## Entry Points (Stop Here)

| Pattern                                     | Type        |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `def mount/3`, `def handle_event/3`         | LiveView    |
| `def index/2`, `def show/2`, `def create/2` | Controller  |
| `def perform(%Oban.Job{})`                  | Oban Worker |
| `def handle_call/3`, `def handle_cast/2`    | GenServer   |

## Delegate to call-tracer Agent

For full recursive tree with argument extraction and **parallel category tracing**:

```
Task(subagent_type: "call-tracer", prompt: "Build call tree for MyApp.Accounts.update_user/2")
```

The call-tracer agent uses **parallel subagents** for each entry point category:

- Controllers subagent (HTTP paths)
- LiveView subagent (WebSocket paths)
- Workers subagent (Background jobs)
- Internal subagent (Cross-context calls)

Each gets fresh 200k context for deep exploration.
