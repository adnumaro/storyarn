# Resolution Template

Use this template when creating solution documentation in `.claude/solutions/`.

## Filename Convention

```
{sanitized-symptom}-{module}-{YYYYMMDD}.md
```

- Lowercase, hyphen-separated
- Special characters removed
- Truncated under 80 characters
- Example: `association-not-loaded-accounts-20251201.md`

# {Descriptive Title}

## Symptoms

What was observed. Include:

- Error messages (exact text)
- Unexpected behavior description
- Where it manifested (which LiveView, which context, which test)

## Investigation

What was tried and what happened:

1. **Hypothesis 1**: {what you thought} — {result}
2. **Hypothesis 2**: {what you thought} — {result}
3. **Root cause found**: {the actual cause}

## Root Cause

Detailed explanation of WHY this happened. Connect to the
underlying Elixir/Phoenix concept.

```elixir
# The problematic code
problematic_code()
```

## Solution

The fix that resolved it.

```elixir
# The working code
fixed_code()
```

### Files Changed

- `lib/my_app/accounts.ex:42` — Added preload
- `test/my_app/accounts_test.exs:15` — Added test for preload

## Prevention

How to prevent this from recurring:

- [ ] Add to Iron Laws? (if foundational pattern)
- [ ] Add to agent checks? (if detectable by reviewer)
- [ ] Add to test patterns? (if testable)
- Specific guidance: "{actionable advice}"

## Related

- `.claude/solutions/{related-file}.md` — Similar issue in different context
