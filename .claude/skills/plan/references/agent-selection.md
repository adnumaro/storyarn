| Feature Type          | Agents to Spawn                                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| CRUD feature          | patterns-analyst, ecto                                    |
| Interactive UI        | patterns-analyst, liveview                                |
| External integration  | patterns-analyst, otp (+ hex-researcher ONLY if new lib)  |
| Background processing | patterns-analyst, oban, otp                               |
| Data-heavy            | patterns-analyst, ecto (+ hex-researcher ONLY if new lib) |
| Real-time             | patterns-analyst, liveview                                |
| Auth/permissions      | patterns-analyst, security-analyzer                       |
| Refactoring           | patterns-analyst, call-tracer                             |
| Review fix (simple)   | patterns-analyst only                                     |
| Review fix (complex)  | patterns-analyst + relevant specialists                   |
| Full new feature      | ALL relevant agents                                       |

## When to Spawn hex-library-researcher

**Spawn ONLY when:**

- Feature requires a NEW library not yet in mix.exs
- Evaluating ALTERNATIVE libraries to replace an existing dep

**Do NOT spawn when:**

- Library is already in mix.exs (use Read/Grep on `deps/` instead)
- Fixing review blockers (libraries already chosen)
- Refactoring existing code
- Understanding API of an existing dependency
- Simple bug fixes or improvements

**To understand an existing library's API:**

- Use `Read` on `deps/{library}/lib/` source code
- Use `Grep` to find function signatures and docs
- Do NOT spawn hex-library-researcher for this

## When to Spawn web-researcher

**Spawn when:**

- Feature involves unfamiliar library/pattern
- Need community input (ElixirForum discussions)
- Looking for real-world examples
- Checking for known issues/gotchas
- CI/CD or infrastructure questions

**Do NOT spawn when:**

- Standard CRUD feature
- Well-known patterns (auth, pagination)
- Codebase already has similar implementation

## When to Spawn call-tracer

Spawn when planning involves:

- **Changing function signatures** — Need all callers and argument patterns
- **Moving/renaming functions** — Need all call paths
- **Refactoring contexts** — Need data flow understanding

## When to Ask Clarifying Questions

**Ask if:**

- Multiple valid approaches exist
- Scope is ambiguous
- Performance requirements unclear
- Integration points undefined

**Don't ask if:**

- Best practice is clear
- Codebase shows clear patterns
- Feature is well-specified

Max 3 questions. Make them count.
