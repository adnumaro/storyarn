# Review Elixir/Phoenix Code

Review code by spawning parallel specialist agents. Find and
explain issues — do NOT create tasks or fix anything.

## Usage

```
/phx:review                          # Review all changed files
/phx:review test                     # Review test files only
/phx:review security                 # Run security audit only
/phx:review oban                     # Review Oban workers only
/phx:review .claude/plans/auth/plan.md    # Review implementation of plan
```

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` = Focus area or path to plan file.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Changed Files and Prepare Directories

```bash
# CRITICAL: Create output dirs BEFORE spawning agents — agents
# cannot create directories and will fail repeatedly on writes
SLUG="$(basename "$(ls -td .claude/plans/*/ 2>/dev/null | head -1)" 2>/dev/null || echo "review")"
mkdir -p ".claude/plans/${SLUG}/reviews" ".claude/plans/${SLUG}/summaries"

# If no plan context, use fallback directory
mkdir -p .claude/reviews

git diff --name-only HEAD~5   # Recent changes
git diff --name-only main     # Or changes from main
```

### Step 1b: Load Plan Context (Scratchpad)

If reviewing a plan, read `.claude/plans/${SLUG}/scratchpad.md` for
planning decisions, rationale, and handoff notes. Include relevant
decisions in each agent's prompt so they have context about WHY
code was written a certain way. This eliminates session archaeology.

### Step 1c: Check Prior Review Output

Before spawning agents, check for existing review files:

```bash
ls .claude/plans/${SLUG}/reviews/ 2>/dev/null
ls .claude/plans/${SLUG}/summaries/review-consolidated.md 2>/dev/null
```

If prior reviews exist, read the consolidated summary and include
it in each agent's prompt as "PRIOR FINDINGS" context with the
instruction: "Focus on NEW issues. Mark still-present issues as
PERSISTENT. Do NOT re-report issues that have been fixed."

### Step 2: Spawn Review Agents (MANDATORY)

**NEVER spawn the same agent role twice in one review.** If reviewing
a plan, scope ALL agents to the plan's changed files in a single pass.
Do NOT run a scoped review followed by a broader review — one pass per role.

You MUST spawn agents using the Task tool. Do NOT analyze code
yourself — delegate to agents.

**For `/phx:review` or `/phx:review all` — spawn ALL 4 in ONE
message (parallel).** Use these EXACT subagent_type values:

| Agent               | subagent_type                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Elixir Reviewer     | `elixir-phoenix:elixir-reviewer`     |
| Testing Reviewer    | `elixir-phoenix:testing-reviewer`    |
| Security Analyzer   | `elixir-phoenix:security-analyzer`   |
| Verification Runner | `elixir-phoenix:verification-runner` |

Spawn ALL agents with `mode: "bypassPermissions"` and
`run_in_background: true` — background agents cannot answer
interactive Bash permission prompts.

**For focused reviews — spawn the specified agent only:**

| Argument    | subagent_type                         |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| `test`      | `elixir-phoenix:testing-reviewer`     |
| `security`  | `elixir-phoenix:security-analyzer`    |
| `oban`      | `elixir-phoenix:oban-specialist`      |

Zero agents spawned = skill failure.

### Step 3: Collect and Compress Findings

Wait for ALL agents to FULLY complete using TaskOutput with
`block: true` for each agent. **Do NOT report status until
every single agent has completed** — ignore intermediate
completion notifications.

**Verification-runner fallback**: If the verification-runner
agent fails or times out, run verification directly. Scope
format checks to changed files only:

```bash
mix compile --warnings-as-errors
CHANGED=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~5 | grep '\.exs\?$' | tr '\n' ' ')
if [ -n "$CHANGED" ]; then mix format --check-formatted $CHANGED; fi
mix credo --strict && mix test
```

Do NOT leave verification incomplete.

**For full reviews (5 agents):** After all agents complete,
spawn `elixir-phoenix:context-supervisor` to compress output:

```
Prompt: "Compress review agent output.
  input_dir: .claude/plans/{slug}/reviews
  output_dir: .claude/plans/{slug}/summaries
  output_file: review-consolidated.md
  priority_instructions: BLOCKERs and WARNINGs: KEEP ALL.
    SUGGESTIONs: COMPRESS similar ones into groups.
    Deconfliction: when multiple agents flag same code,
    keep the most specific finding."
```

**For focused reviews (1 agent):** Skip supervisor, read
agent output directly.

### Step 4: Generate Review Summary

Read the consolidated summary (full review) or agent output
(focused review). Write to `.claude/plans/{slug}/reviews/{feature}-review.md`
with verdict: PASS | PASS WITH WARNINGS | REQUIRES CHANGES | BLOCKED.

### Step 5: Present Findings and Ask User

**STOP and present the review.** Do NOT create tasks or fix
anything.

**On BLOCKED or REQUIRES CHANGES**: Show finding count by
severity, then offer concrete options via `AskUserQuestion`:

- **Replan fixes** — `/phx:plan .claude/plans/{slug}/reviews/{file}.md`
- **Fix directly** — fix blockers now in this session
- **Handle myself** — I'll take it from here

**On PASS / PASS WITH WARNINGS**: Suggest `/phx:compound`,
`/phx:learn`. If warnings reveal scope gaps,
also suggest: `/phx:plan .claude/plans/{slug}/reviews/{file}.md`
to create a follow-up plan from review findings.

## Iron Laws

1. **Review is READ-ONLY** — Find and explain, never fix
2. **NEVER auto-fix after review** — Always ask the user first
3. **Always offer both paths**: `/phx:plan` and `/phx:work`
4. **Research before claiming** — Agents MUST research before
   making claims about CI/CD or external services

## Integration with Workflow

```text
/phx:plan → /phx:work
       ↓
/phx:review  ← YOU ARE HERE (findings only, no tasks)
       ↓
   Blocked? → /phx:plan or /phx:work
   Pass    → /phx:compound (capture solutions)
```
