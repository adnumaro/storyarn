## Next Steps

- I'll handle it myself

```

## Verdict Decision Rules

| Verdict | Conditions |
|---------|-----------|
| **PASS** | No blockers, no warnings, suggestions only |
| **PASS WITH WARNINGS** | No blockers, warnings present but not test-coverage gaps |
| **REQUIRES CHANGES** | No Iron Law blockers, but test coverage gaps detected (see below) |
| **BLOCKED** | Iron Law violations or critical security/data issues |

### REQUIRES CHANGES Triggers

This verdict catches code that works but lacks adequate test coverage:

- New public functions with zero tests
- Removed tests without replacement coverage
- New `handle_event` callbacks without corresponding tests
- New Oban workers without `perform/1` tests
- New LiveView routes without basic mount/render tests

These are not blockers (code works) but should not merge without tests.

**IMPORTANT**: The review template does NOT include task lists (`- [ ]`),
fix phases, or plan modifications. Review is findings-only. Task creation
belongs in `/phx:plan`.
