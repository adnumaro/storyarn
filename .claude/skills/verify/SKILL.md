# Verification Loop

Complete verification workflow for Elixir/Phoenix projects. Run this after making changes to ensure code quality before
commits or PRs.

## Iron Laws - Never Violate These

1. **Run in order** - Each step must pass before proceeding to the next
2. **Fix issues immediately** - Don't batch fixes; address each failure before continuing
3. **Warnings are errors** - Use `--warnings-as-errors` flag; no exceptions
4. **Full Dialyzer before PR** - Always run Dialyzer before creating pull requests

## Verification Sequence

Execute these commands in order, stopping on any failure:

### Step 1: Compilation (Fast Feedback)

```bash
mix compile --warnings-as-errors
```

Catches: Undefined functions, missing modules, type mismatches, unused variables

### Step 2: Formatting

```bash
mix format --check-formatted
```

If fails: Run `mix format` and re-check

### Step 3: Credo Analysis

```bash
mix credo --strict
```

Address all issues marked as consistency or design problems

### Step 4: Run Tests

```bash
# For specific context changes
mix test test/my_app/[changed_context]_test.exs --trace

# For full test suite
mix test --trace
```

All tests must pass

### Step 5: Dialyzer (Pre-PR Required)

```bash
mix dialyzer
```

No new warnings allowed. First run builds PLT cache (slow).

**Handling Dialyzer warnings**: Prefer fixing over suppressing.
If suppression is necessary, add to `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` with
a comment explaining why. Never suppress warnings you don't
understand — investigate first.

## Quick Reference

| Step     | Command                            | Time   | When Required |
|----------|------------------------------------|--------|---------------|
| Compile  | `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` | Fast   | Always        |
| Format   | `mix format --check-formatted`     | Fast   | Always        |
| Credo    | `mix credo --strict`               | Medium | Always        |
| Test     | `mix test --trace`                 | Medium | Always        |
| Dialyzer | `mix dialyzer`                     | Slow   | Before PR     |

## Usage

After making code changes:

1. Run `/phx:verify` to execute the full loop
2. Address any failures before proceeding
3. Commit only after all checks pass

For partial verification during development, run individual steps as needed.
