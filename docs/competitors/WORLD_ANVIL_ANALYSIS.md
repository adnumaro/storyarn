## 34. Known Limitations & Criticism

### Interface & Usability

- **Steep learning curve** — overwhelming number of features and options for new users
- **Cluttered interface** — many article types packed with options slow down workflow
- **BBCode learning curve** — Advanced Editor requires BBCode knowledge for complex layouts
- **Text editor feels dated** — described as "stuck in the 2000s" by some reviewers
- **Editor switching risks** — switching from Euclid to Visual can cause content/formatting loss

### Free Tier Restrictions

- **Public-only worlds** — no private content on free tier
- **Article limit** — reduced from 100+ to ~42, then restored to ~175 (still limiting for serious worldbuilders)
- **Pop-up ads** — full-screen upsell popups every ~20 minutes with 6-second wait to close
- Users report feeling their work is "held at ransom" when limits change

### Collaboration

- **No real-time collaboration** — async only, no live cursors or concurrent editing
- **No manuscript collaboration** — co-authors locked out of Manuscripts tool
- **No commenting system** — no inline comments on articles (Google-Docs-style)

### Performance

- **Slowdown with media-heavy worlds** — large image collections impact performance
- **Category rendering limits** — max 50 articles per category in view
- **BBCode rendering** — complex layouts can be slow

### Business Practices (User Complaints)

- **Auto-renewal without warning** — no recharge notification emails before subscription renewal
- **No refund policy** — refund requests reportedly denied
- **Feature gating concerns** — formerly free features moved behind paywalls

### Missing Features

- No AI-assisted content generation
- No game engine integration plugins (Unity, Unreal, Godot)
- No built-in version control for articles
- No branching narrative / dialogue flow tools
- No scripting language for interactive logic
