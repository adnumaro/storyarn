# Slice 4 — "My AI Team": Role Assignments per Capability (+ DeepL unification)

## Objective

A "My AI Team" section INSIDE the integrations page where the user assigns connected providers to role slots — **Translator, Writing assistant, Illustrator, Analyst** — constrained by each provider's capabilities. Provider required, model optional (owner-decided); assignments drive provider resolution for localization and the later Slices 9–10. Includes the LLM-translation path (Translator can point at Claude/GPT/etc. instead of DeepL) **and completes the DeepL unification started in Slice 0**: localization consumes the per-user DeepL integration through the Translator assignment and the legacy per-project config is removed. Positioned right after the BYOK lane so the "which AI do I use at the limit" decision surface exists as soon as limits are reachable.

## Problem & proposed solution

**Problem:** with 7 providers and 4 usage classes, "which AI does what" becomes an implicit, confusing rule set; users cannot express preferences like "Claude for translations instead of DeepL".
**Solution:** an explicit roster. Each role slot shows a dropdown of eligible providers (connected ∩ capable); optional model pin populated from the same `GET /models` response that validated the key (unpinned = our recommended default per provider). **The team page also manages the user-marked DEFAULT AI (owner-decided): one provider marked as default with the explicit hint "this is the model used when you hit the platform AI limit"** — the same designation the Slice-3 opt-in modal creates. **The single-default rule is database-enforced: `is_default` on `ai_integrations` with a partial unique index `(user_id) WHERE is_default AND revoked_at IS NULL`; changing the default is an atomic swap (unset+set in one transaction), covered by a concurrency test.** Consumers resolve `provider_for(user, role)` through one function; **an unassigned role resolves to the default if capable, otherwise an explicit error + CTA to this page — there is NO auto-pick**. **Analyst is NOT an assignable slot in v1**: it renders as a fixed, disabled slot showing "Storyarn AI (internal)" — `provider_for/2` always resolves Analyst to the internal lane and rejects assignment writes for it (the BYOK Analyst role is an explicit backlog item). The team metaphor doubles as the differentiator narrative for game devs.

## Architectural direction

- Data: `ai_role_assignments` (user_id, role, provider, model nullable, **language nullable — column ships now, per-language Translator routing UI is backlog with zero future migration**). Uniqueness must handle Postgres NULL semantics explicitly: a **partial unique index `(user_id, role) WHERE language IS NULL`** (the default row) plus a **unique index `(user_id, role, language) WHERE language IS NOT NULL`** — a plain unique on the triple would allow multiple NULL-language rows and break resolution. Verified in migration tests.
- Resolution: `Storyarn.AI.provider_for(user, role)` via the facade; consumed by `BatchTranslator` (Translator) now and Slices 9 (Writing assistant) / 10 (Illustrator) when they land. Assignments validated against capabilities at write time AND resolution time. **Disconnected-assignment chain (owner-decided): if the assigned provider is revoked/disconnected, resolution uses the user's DEFAULT (if healthy) with a visible notice + link to the broken assignment; if the default is also unavailable → explicit error, no degradation.**
- **DeepL unification (second half — adapter shipped in Slice 0)**: `BatchTranslator` resolves credentials through the Translator assignment; the legacy `translation_provider_configs` schema/CRUD and its project-settings UI are removed. **Live rows: DROP + in-app/email notice + reconnect (owner-decided 2026-07-21 — platform has ~2 real users; copying a key to the project owner's account could hand user A's credential to user B, so migration-by-copy is ruled out).** **Migration order matters: FIRST materialize durable notification records (affected user ids + delivery state) from the legacy rows, THEN drop, THEN send emails post-commit — so retries and in-app "seen" tracking survive the drop.** Localization settings keeps a read-only pointer ("managed in AI Integrations").
- **LLM translation**: a `BatchTranslator` provider implementation that routes through `AI.execute` on the BYOK lane (`byok_only` for v1 — translation volume on credits is a Slice 11 pricing question, not assumed). DeepL remains the recommended Translator default when connected.
- Model pinning: models fetched at connect/validation time and cached on the integration row (refresh on revalidate); the dropdown never blocks on a live provider call.
- UI: a section under the cards grid in the integrations page (no third settings surface — owner-decided); each slot: role icon, eligible-provider dropdown, optional model select, capability-aware empty state ("connect a provider with translation capability").

## Existing code to reuse (do not duplicate)

Slice 0 integrations page + `IntegrationCrud` + DeepL adapter (PR #28) · Slice 3 capabilities metadata + lane resolution + consent/badges · `BatchTranslator` abstraction + legacy `translation_provider_configs` code (to port, then delete) · `Storyarn.Localization` translation flows · shadcn `ui/select`/combobox components (registry check — no new dropdown primitives) · `FeatureFlags` · gettext/i18n infra · `Shared.Validations` patterns for changeset checks.

## Applicable conventions (MUST be surfaced in chat during implementation)

Facade-only resolution API · authorization: assignments are own-scope mutations on the settings LV · capability constraints enforced server-side (UI hiding is not enough — project auth rule applied to data validity) · i18n en/es for roles/empty states (role names are product vocabulary — owner reviews copy) · Lucide icons per role · no `<select>` daisy patterns — use the existing combobox/join-button conventions · migration verify on dev DB.

## Observability & error handling

Assignment/default changes to PostHog via the `Storyarn.Analytics` allowlist (role, provider — no keys; events registered with tests) · **resolution outcomes persist in a constrained `resolution_outcome` column on `ai_usage_events` (`assigned | default_with_notice | resolution_error`); a failed resolution still writes an operation/usage event so the error is queryable, not just flashed** · the disconnected-assignment notice is a visible, dismissible UI state with a link — never a log-only event · migration drop notices: durable records created pre-drop, delivery tracked (in-app seen + email sent) · user docs: My AI Team + default AI semantics documented in the flag-hidden AI docs.

## Verification / Definition of Done

- ExUnit: assignment changesets (capability mismatch rejected, Analyst writes rejected, partial-unique NULL semantics), `provider_for/2` resolution matrix per the decided chain (**assigned-healthy / assigned-down→default-with-notice / default-down→explicit error / unassigned→default-if-capable else error+CTA — NO auto-pick anywhere**), single-default atomic swap under concurrency, LLM-translation provider through the BYOK lane (no credit debit), model-pin persistence and cache refresh, migration creates notification records BEFORE drop + removal leaves no dead references (`mix compile --warning-as-errors`).
- Vitest: team section (eligible filtering per role, model dropdown states, empty states), assignment flow emits.
- Browser: assign Claude as Translator with DeepL also connected → run a batch translation on Claude · disconnect Claude → translation runs on the marked default WITH the visible notice + link · disconnect the default too → explicit error, nothing runs · unassign with no default marked → explicit error + CTA. Badge always shows the executing provider.
- Lint fix as last command before push · `just quality-lint` green + full suites.

## Delivery

Branch `feat/ai-team-assignments` from main → PR → merge before Slice 5+. Flag: `:ai_integrations` (the single AI flag).

## Inputs from previous slices

Slices 0 and 3 merged. Slices 9–10 consume `provider_for/2` when they land. Estimate: **12–16h** (includes the DeepL consumption switch + legacy removal).
